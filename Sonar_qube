Issues:
1. if we install mutliple java version sonarqube will not understand to run on which java version . in this case we have to edit the file 
  to update exact java home path under <project dir>/conf/wrapper.conf
[sonar@ip-172-31-19-34 conf]$ cat wrapper.conf
# Path to JVM executable. By default it must be available in PATH.
# Can be an absolute path, for example:
#wrapper.java.command=/path/to/my/jdk/bin/java
wrapper.java.command=/usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.8.0-openjdk/bin/java  } ---> here we have to update and then sonarqube will work
